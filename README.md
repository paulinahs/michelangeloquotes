## Overview

Wanted to have a try at the "Random Quote Generator" with JavaScript as it has been a while since I've even touched it.

<br>

## My process

I decided to make a simple landing page style website with just one other page, just to keep it simple and to the point. The about page briefly explains the fact that I wanted to use javascript for the generator as well as mention the use of boottrap for the navbar.

<br>

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript


<br>

### What I learned

I learned how to put in simple javascript to have the random quotes generator in the website.

<br>

### Continued development

Next time I will be quicker with certain things regarding javascript, but still need to improve.
